Then, the user can view GPS statistics and interact with the map post-process in <a href=\"https://vibrationresearch.com/products/obserview/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">ObserVIEW</a>.",
  "shift": "During a Sine Resonance Track and Dwell (<a href=\"https://vibrationresearch.com/vibrationview/sine-resonance-track-dwell/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">SRTD</a>) test, resonances shift as material fatigues. For the test to be valid, the test frequency also needs to shift. An engineer needs insight into these shifts; ideally, the engineer should learn the details of multiple resonances during an SRTD initial sweep, then select a resonance for a Dwell, and run that test with confidence that the frequency will stay on the resonance. <a href=\"https://vibrationresearch.com/resources/peak-tracking-in-vibrationview/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Read more</a>.",
  "sdof": "A single mass connected to a spring represents the most simple vibratory system. The mass can only travel along the direction of the spring’s elongation. Therefore, the system has a single-degree-of-freedom (SDOF).",
  "middle": "A <a href=\"https://vru.vibrationresearch.com/lesson/filtering/#:~:text=more%20readily%20apparent.-,BANDPASS%20FILTER,-A%20bandpass%20filter\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">bandpass filter</a> accepts a middle-frequency band and rejects everything above and below.",
  "hammer": "The ObserVIEW <a href=\"https://vibrationresearch.com/obserview/modal-testing/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Modal Testing module</a> is compatible with a modal impact hammer for excitation. An impact hammer is a measurement tool that produces short-duration excitation upon impact with a structure. The ObserVR1000 records the impulse via the hammer’s force sensor and the structure’s output via the response accelerometers.",
  "log": "Many physical phenomena exhibit log-normal distribution. When a system’s response amplitude is the product of multiple independent parameters, the distribution of the response amplitude tends to be log-normal. Learn more about how the distribution applies to random vibration at <a href=\"https://vru.vibrationresearch.com/lesson/log-normal-distribution/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">VRU</a>.",
  "action": "With the VR mobile <a href=\"https://vibrationresearch.com/resources/applications-for-triggering-vr-mobile/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">triggering</a> feature, users can instruct the ObserVR1000 vibration controller to perform an automatic action such as record or power off. Triggering can replace a repetitive action, thereby saving time, and/or ensuring specific parameters are met. The user can define one or multiple custom behaviors for greater ease and accuracy during vibration testing.",
  "tests": "Random vibration tests and Field Data Replication (FDR) are both suitable in many testing situations involving random vibration.",

  "device": "The device under test (DUT) or unit under test (UUT) is the product being tested on the shaker system.",
  "aging": "Burn-in is caused by continuously powering a product, often at constant elevated temperature, in order to accelerate the aging process.",
  "fuse": "RF noise can be <a href=\"https://vibrationresearch.com/resources/noise-troubleshooting/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">addressed</a> by using the jumpers on the front of the VR9500. By placing these jumpers in the connected position the input ground is tied directly to the chassis ground, bypassing the input ground fuse that converts electromagnetic interference (EMI) to a voltage. This will reduce the effects of the EMI that is introduced into the system by the input cable.",
  "torque": "Torque is a twisting force that tends to cause rotation.",
  "flex": "In applied mechanics, bending (also known as flexure) characterizes the behavior of a slender structural element subjected to an external load applied perpendicularly to a longitudinal axis of the element. It is important to periodically assess if the shaker in your lab is performing properly. Poor shaker performance—possibly caused by a crack in the armature or flexure fatigue—will negatively affect test results performed on the shaker.",
  "lines": "<a href=\"https://vibrationresearch.com/vibrationview/idof/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Instant Degrees of Freedom®</a> (iDOF) provides the smoothest control lines in the industry, enabling highly accurate vibration tests in a condensed period.",
  "flaw": "Frequently, our customers will request advice on which of these test types to run on their product, and in particular, how to choose between the two most common test types: sine and random. Their desire is to know which test, sine or random, is best to most quickly pinpoint flaws in their product.",
  "plane": "It is important to consider the orientation of the accelerometer when mounting. A single-axis accelerometer only measures data in one specific direction. For example, if the vibration of the DUT is in a horizontal plane and the accelerometer is mounted to collect data from the vertical plane, then the accelerometer will not read the correct vibration if any vibration at all.",
  "stroke": "Shakers have limits for force, mass and acceleration, but they also have limits for velocity, displacement (aka “stroke”), and drive voltage. <a href=\"https://vibrationresearch.com/products/vibrationview/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">VibrationVIEW</a> includes limit fields for these parameters as well. Always double-check your shaker manual for the correct ratings.",

  "create": "In vibration testing, test engineers seek to <a href=\"https://vibrationresearch.com/blog/create-vibration-test-data-recording/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">create test profiles</a> that reflect the real world as close as possible. This helps to ensure that the product can withstand the vibration events it will experience in its lifetime.",
  "noisy": "Apply a <a href=\"https://vru.vibrationresearch.com/lesson/filtering/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">filter</a> when you want to discriminate data based on frequency. An example of this is smoothing a noisy data sequence by attenuating rapidly changing (high-frequency) components.",
  "gal": "The unit gal represents an acceleration of 1 cm/sec². A typical earthquake measures around 250gal near the epicenter, and 400gal is sometimes specified for earthquake testing. 980.6gal = 1g.",
  "cursor": "A cursor displays the data at its current location. Cursors are <a href=\"https://vibrationresearch.com/resources/vibrationview-random-cursors/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">configured three ways in VibrationVIEW</a>. The display cursor displays information in the Graph Cursor window; the Annotate Graph option adds a trace to the graph; the Use Peaks option uses traces to find peaks and valleys.",
  "length": "The maximum cable length depends on the type of accelerometer and cable. For instance, if you are using charge mode accelerometers, the distance between the accelerometer and the charge barrel/amplifier needs to be short. These accelerometers output very low voltage levels, and any noise that the cable absorbs from the environment can cause variation in the signal. <a href=\"https://vibrationresearch.com/blog/which-accelerometer-should-i-use/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Read more</a>."
